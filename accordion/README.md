Accordion
Design and implement an accordion component using Vanilla JavaScript.

Requirements:

- Create an accordion that includes at least three sections (expandable/collapsible).
- Ensure that the active section is visually distinct from inactive sections.
- Implement the solution using clean and readable code.

Bonus:

- Implement a default section that is expanded on the initial page load.
- Consider scalability and discuss how you might handle adding more accordions or content
  sections dynamically.
