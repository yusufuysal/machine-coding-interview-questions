Tabs
Create a simple tabbed interface using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
The tabs should switch content when clicked and have a visual indication for the active tab.
Design the structure and functionality of these tabs.

Requirements:

- Create Three tabs labeled "Tab 1," "Tab 2," and "Tab 3".
- Implement functionality such that clicking on a tab changes the displayed content and visibly identifies the active tab.
- Ensure code readability, modularity, and appropriate comments.

Bonus:

- Implement a default tab that is active on page load.
- Consider scalability and discuss how you might handle adding more tabs or content sections dynamically.
